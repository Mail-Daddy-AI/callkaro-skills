# CallKaro MCP

Remote MCP server, Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1, no local install.

```
https://mcp.callkaro.ai/api/mcp
```

It sits on the same backend as the CLI and covers the same areas: agents and versions, calls, batches, simulations, numbers, secrets (read only), analytics, audit strategies, chat agents. Tool names get the server name as a prefix, e.g. `mcp__callkaro__get_agent`. The name is whatever the client registered (`callkaro`, `callkaro-probe`), so match on the tail.

## Pick the tool: MCP or CLI

Default: **use whichever is already connected, and prefer the CLI for anything that writes an object or array field.** Then apply this table.

| Task | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing a new agent from scratch | MCP | `search_reference_versions` and the `get_agent_*_reference` tools have no CLI equivalent |
| Understanding one big version | MCP | `inspect_agent_version` returns one section at a time (script, functions, pathway graph, post-call). CLI `agents get` returns it all |
| Looking up the authoring rules | MCP | ten `get_agent_*_reference` tools, one per topic (script, functions, post-call, LLM, STT, TTS, settings, translation, creation) |
| Editing `voice_configuration`, `transcriber`, `functions`, `customPronunciations`, `preFormatVariables` | CLI | `ck agents update` merges these against the target version in code. The MCP expects you to send the complete object |
| Any scripted, piped or repeated job | CLI | `--json`, `--wait`, exit codes, no model in the loop |
| Placing a test call | either | needs fresh user approval each time, on both |
| Reading a call and its log | either | `get_call` + `query_call_logs` vs `ck calls get` + `ck calls logs` (same virtual `/call.log`) |
| Running simulations | either | MCP can also step one turn at a time with `generate_simulation_reply`; CLI has `sim run --wait` |
| Batch retries and receipts | MCP | `get_batch_receipts`, `get_not_connected_batch_calls`, `retry_not_connected_batch_calls` |
| KPI board, call analyzers, saved sim variable sets, any dashboard route | CLI only | needs the dashboard cookie, see [ck](../tools/ck.md) |
| `ongoing pause/resume/clear`, `agents export/import`, `monitor`, per-folder accounts | CLI only | no MCP tool (the MCP only has `get_queue_status`) |
| A/B routing | either | MCP sets `abTestEnabled`, `abTestVersions`, `advancedAbTestRules` through `update_agent`. Same whole-object caution as below |
| Secrets | CLI to write; MCP can list, rename, remove | MCP `set_secret` only points the user to the dashboard and takes no value, on purpose |
| Billing credits | MCP | `get_account_credit_status`, if the account has billing access |
| Working from Claude web or desktop with no terminal | MCP | nothing to install |

If a task lands in the "CLI only" rows and no terminal is available, say so. Do not improvise through raw REST.

## Rules that stop real damage

1. **Check which account the MCP is signed in as before any write.** The MCP login is an OAuth session, separate from `.ck.json` and `ck login`. Call `get_account_details`, and if the CLI is present compare with `ck whoami`. Two different accounts means the CLI and MCP are editing different workspaces. Stop and tell the user.
2. **Never edit a live agent without an explicit go-ahead.** `update_agent`, `publish_agent`, `toggle_agent_version`, `update_chat_agent`, `publish_chat_agent_version`, `update_number_spam_status` and `release_phone_number` change shared state. A forwarded bug report means diagnose and propose.
3. **Inspect before update.** Run `inspect_agent_version` with `interface_index` plus every section you will touch, with `fullText` and `includeSourceCode` for anything you rewrite. Previews are not enough to modify.
4. **Send only changed fields, and keep whole objects whole.** The MCP's own guidance is "preserve unrelated complete objects", and for `customPronunciations` and `preFormatVariables` "send the complete desired map". Whether the backend merges a partial object has not been verified. Treat a partial `voice_configuration` or `functions` array as destructive. Read the current value, edit it, send the whole thing, then `inspect_agent_version` again to confirm nothing else moved.
5. **Version-level changes need a `versionId`.** Without it the backend rejects the update.
6. **Test calls need fresh approval every time.** `make_call` and `create_batch` or `schedule_batch` start real calls. Simulations (`create_simulation_run`) are fine without asking.
7. **Never invent ids.** Agent, version, number, voice, model and template ids come from a list or inspect call. The MCP says this in every reference tool.
8. **No secrets in chat.** Do not paste a client secret or token into an MCP argument. Point the user to the dashboard vault.
9. **`list_agents` is not paginated** and can return tens of KB. Pipe or truncate before reading, or use the CLI with `--json` and a filter.

## Common flows

**New agent.** `search_reference_versions` (never for translation) → `inspect_agent_version` on the best matches → `get_agent_script_reference` and whichever other reference covers the fields → draft → `create_agent` → `create_test_case` + `create_simulation_run` → report. Publish only on request. House method for the design itself: [agent design](../design/agent-design.md).

**Translate a version.** `get_agent_translation_reference` → `inspect_agent_version` on the source, complete → `clone_agent_version` with the target language, voice and transcriber (`list_voice_providers`, `get_voice_provider_metadata`, `list_transcribers`) → `update_agent` the clone's spoken text only. Never `search_reference_versions` here.

**Debug a bad call.** `get_call` → `query_call_logs` (`grep -E ' - (ERROR|WARNING) - ' /call.log`) → `inspect_agent_version` on the version that ran → fix at the right layer. Method: [review debug](../quality/review-debug.md).

**Failed batch rows.** `get_batch_status` → `get_not_connected_batch_calls` → `retry_not_connected_batch_calls` with the `maxTryCount` the status reports.

## Install and auto-setup

Setup registers the URL once per client, then the user signs in once in a browser. **An agent cannot complete the OAuth step.** It has no browser callback, so do the registration and hand the login to the user.

### One command

From this skill's folder (or wherever it was installed):

```bash
node scripts/setup-mcp.js                 # every supported client it finds on this machine
node scripts/setup-mcp.js --dry-run       # print what it would do, change nothing
node scripts/setup-mcp.js --client claude --scope user
node scripts/setup-mcp.js --client codex|cursor|vscode|all
```

Idempotent: re-running reports `present`. It never reads or writes credentials. It exits 1 if no client is found or a registration fails, and prints the manual command.

The setup script is not included in this pack; get it from the upstream skills repository.

### What it runs, per client

| Client | Registration | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user callkaro https://mcp.callkaro.ai/api/mcp` | `claude mcp login callkaro`, or `/mcp` inside Claude Code. Restart after sign-in so the tools load |
| Codex | `codex mcp add callkaro --url https://mcp.callkaro.ai/api/mcp` | `codex mcp login callkaro` |
| Cursor | merges `{"mcpServers":{"callkaro":{"url":"…"}}}` into `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | Settings → Tools & MCP → enable, sign in |
| VS Code | merges `{"servers":{"callkaro":{"type":"http","url":"…"}}}` into `.vscode/mcp.json` | Command Palette: `MCP: List Servers` → start, sign in |
| Claude web or desktop | Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector, name `CallKaro`, paste the URL, leave client credentials empty | sign in when prompted |
| Anything else | find the MCP or integrations screen, add a remote Streamable HTTP server with the URL | sign in when prompted |

`--scope` for Claude Code: `user` (every project, default here), `local` (this project, private), `project` (writes `.mcp.json`, shared with the repo).

### Sign-in without a desktop browser

```bash
claude mcp login callkaro --no-browser   # prints a URL; open it anywhere, paste the redirect URL back
```

In a Claude Code session the user can type `! claude mcp login callkaro` so it runs with a terminal. An agent cannot.

### Verify

1. `claude mcp list` shows `callkaro` as connected, or "Needs authentication" if the login is not done.
2. Call `get_account_details`. It returns the name and email the MCP is acting as. Compare with `ck whoami`.
3. A 401 with `invalid_token` before login is expected: the server rejects even `initialize` without OAuth.

### Remove

```bash
claude mcp remove callkaro
codex mcp remove callkaro
```

For Cursor and VS Code delete the `callkaro` key from the JSON file.

## Do not

- Do not probe `https://mcp.callkaro.ai/api/mcp` with curl and a CLI token. It accepts OAuth tokens only.
- Do not claim a CLI-only feature exists in the MCP, or the reverse. The table above is the checked list; re-check it against the live tool list, because the server is v1 and moves.
- Do not leave the MCP and CLI on different accounts without telling the user.
